This is a script with some of my customizations to get oh-my-zsh up and running quickly on any machine.

## Getting Started

### Basic Installation
#### via curl

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bharley/oh-my-zsh/master/install.sh)"
```

#### manually

Install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) like you normally would, and copy all of the
contents of this repository into your `$ZSH_CUSTOM` directory.

## Notes

This is designed for my personal use, so it's pretty opinionated.
